# Mail

[DMA](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/mail/#dragonFly-mail-agent), the Dragonfly Mail Agent has been added to freebsd and its great. You can send mail with sendmail, which should seem obvious, but in the modern day, a lot of the sendmails shipped with distributions cant really handle smtp send thru a remote server. DMA provides that functionality.

You can configure it rather easily, just plug in your info in the /etc/dma/dma.conf :


```
SMARTHOST smtp.gmail.com
PORT 587
AUTHPATH /etc/dma/auth.conf
SECURETRANSFER
STARTTLS
MAILNAME gmail.com
MASQUERADE mailaccount@
```
configure the password in /etc/dma/auth.conf:
```
mailacount@gmail.com|smtp.gmail.com:Password
```
If you are using gmail you will have to generate an app password from your google account.

and you can add your user to /etc/mail/aliases:

```
username: mailaccount@gmail.com
```
run newaliases after that.

now you should be able to send an email as simply as:
```
echo "AAAAAAA" | mail -v -s test-email testreceiver@email.com
```
