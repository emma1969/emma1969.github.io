# ipfs / kubo

Kubo is the go implementation of ipfs. You can install it through the FreeBSD package manager. Currently you need to make a few changes.

## Options:
- Edit the existing startup script and replace kubo-go with kubo
- Create a softlink between kubo and kubo-go in /usr/local/bin

Do at least one of the things above, after that you need to change the part where "KUBO_PATH" is defined in command_args
to below:
'''
IPFS_PATH=${kubo_path} KUBO_PATH=${kubo_path}
'''

After these changes you will be able to use the start up script

```
doas service kubo-go enable
doas service kubo-go start
```

in order for your a user to use kubo you must make two changes

```
#add your user to kubo-go group
pw group mod kubo-go -m username
#change permissions of default kubo folder to group read
chmod -Rf g+r /var/db/kubo-go/.kubo 
```

then add this to your shell rc

```
export IPFS_PATH=/var/db/kubo-go/.kubo
```

you should now be able to use kubo as a user on next login, test with:

```
kubo cat /ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG/readme
```
